              💻 I'm a <b>21</b> year old from the West Midlands! <br />
              I've been interested in coding my whole life, but never really had
              the motivation for it. But thanks to
              <a

              I now have the motivation to code and do something I've always
              loved but never really did. <br />
              <br />
              😇 So here I am! Coding and loving every second of it

            <p>
              ⚡ The main thing I do right now is code! <br />
              Everyday I'm making something new with <b>CSS/HTML/JS</b> with the
              eventual goal of becoming a full-stack developer. <br />
              <br />
              🎵 Past coding, I also have an interest in music making! I'm
              learning Piano right now, and all the music theory to go along
              with that. I'm not very good, but with everything in life, if you
              keep trying and enjoy the journey you will improve in no time.
              <br />
              <br />
              🎨 I'm also very interested in Games Workshop! I've always loved
              painting miniatures but I've never really done it a lot because of
              how expensive it is. But now I have a 3D printer and an infinite
              amount of possibilities for paintable models 😄

            <p>
              🤔 I'm not quite sure yet. <br />
              <br />
              👀 I want to learn <b>HTML/CSS</b> and <b>JS</b>, but, in a
              broader sense? I have no idea and I think that's okay for now. I
              want to be a full-stack developer, so that's really my end goal.
              But it isn't my End goal, if you know what I mean. <br />
              <br />
              💖 I want to meet my Boyfriend in real life because I love him
              more than anything! I've known him now for two years, but only
              started dating three months ago, so I would really like to meet
              him. He's in America and I'm planning to visit him sometime near
              December, so I think for now... That's what I want to accomplish
              🥰
