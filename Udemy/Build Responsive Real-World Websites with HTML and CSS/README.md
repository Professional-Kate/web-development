This folder is for the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/" target="_blank">Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS</a>.

This course is all about making real websites, websites that people use. This course will teach me about CSS, HTML and some JavaScript. This course in mainly for the CSS - it's my worst area and I hope to improve that.
