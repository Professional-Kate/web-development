This folder is for the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/" target="_blank">50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript</a>.

I found this course really interesting! Building 50 projects over 50 days (probably longer in my case) is really exciting.

## All of the projects contain
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

And some even contain HTTP requests which is really cool as I am very bad with promises currently.
