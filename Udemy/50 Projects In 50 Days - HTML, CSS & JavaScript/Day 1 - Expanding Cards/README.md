# API_KEY

You need an API key to use the NASA API. I excluded my API key using a separate JS file called "API_KEY.js" then using .gitignore to make sure I don't share it everywhere.

If you want to see how this project works then:

<ol>
  <li>Clone this project</li>
  <li>Download to your machine</li>
  <li>Go into _API_KEY_.js and follow the instructions in there </li>
  <li>It should work!</li>
</ol>
