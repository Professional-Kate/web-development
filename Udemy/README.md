# web-development / Udemy
This folder is for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> projects. I have bought a lot of courses on there, so it's time I complete them :)

## A note. 

Copying full projects from Udemy is something I won't be doing. I will follow the basic idea, "make a todo app", but I won't copy the CSS/HTML/JS - I will make it my own. Half a million people have done some of these courses, I know changing the style won't make me standout but it's better for learning. Copying from Udemy / StackOverflow will teach you <b>Nothing</b> - so I won't be doing that whenever possible.
