About me!

# Who am I?

ðŸ’» I'm a 21 year old from the West Midlands!
I've been interested in coding my whole life, but never really had the motivation for it. But thanks to CYF I now have the motivation to code and do something I've always loved but never really did.

ðŸ˜‡ So here I am! Coding and loving every second of it

# What do I do?

âš¡ The main thing I do right now is code!
Everyday I'm making something new with CSS/HTML/JS with the eventual goal of becoming a full-stack developer.

ðŸŽµ Past coding, I also have an interest in music making! I'm learning Piano right now, and all the music theory to go along with that. I'm not very good, but with everything in life, if you keep trying and enjoy the journey you will improve in no time.

ðŸŽ¨ I'm also very interested in Games Workshop! I've always loved painting miniatures but I've never really done it a lot because of how expensive it is. But now I have a 3D printer and an infinite amount of possibilities for paintable models ðŸ˜„

# What do I want to accomplish

ðŸ¤” I'm not quite sure yet.

ðŸ‘€ I want to learn HTML/CSS and JS, but, in a broader sense? I have no idea and I think that's okay for now. I want to be a full-stack developer, so that's really my end goal. But it isn't my End goal, if you know what I mean.

ðŸ’– I want to meet my Boyfriend in real life because I love him more than anything! I've known him now for two years, but only started dating three months ago, so I would really like to meet him. He's in America and I'm planning to visit him sometime near December, so I think for now... That's what I want to accomplish ðŸ¥°
